## Overview of Sparkmail service
Sparkmail consists of two main components, the Sparkmail Bot, and Mailgun.

Messages between Spark and Sparkbot are only triggered webhooks passed over HTTP with message tokens.  Sparkbot then interacts with Cisco Spark via SSL to retrieve information regarding the message, room, and members.

Next Sparkbot packages the message and sends it to Mailgun via SSL
